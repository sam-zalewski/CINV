Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is one of the most common symptoms recorded by patients undergoing chemotherapy, particu-
larly when taking highly emetogenic treatments such as cisplatin. The 2000s saw the breakout approval of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists,
which were able to reduce these symptoms at a higher rate than traditional antiemetics. As neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists gained popularity,
newer drugs of this class were developed, both to improve efficacy or to resolve pharmacokinetic limitations of the previous drugs. A summary
of the studies investigating the use of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists over the past two decades provides key insight to some of the most
promising antiemetics in contemporary medicine, as well as the statistical methods used to support such a statement.
