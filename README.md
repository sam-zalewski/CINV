# A Historical and Statistical Overview of NK1 Receptor Antagonists in the Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

## Abstract

 Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is a common condition that significantly impacts the comfort and treatment adherence of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Since the early 2000s, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists have gained popularity as an alternative to traditional antiemetics used to manage these symptoms. A summary of studies investigating the use of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists over the past two decades provides key insight into some of the most promising antiemetics in oncology, the statistical methods used in their comparative analyses, and potential strategies for furthering their clinical efficacy based on emerging data.
